The bootstrap call must be made to discover what 'stations' exist. Stations have a station type
which we might be able to match to Ubidots device types. Stations have locations, created/updated at,
and an array of sensor groups. A sensor group seems to correspond to what we think of as a phyiscal device.

A customer has 'systems' (a site?) that has 'stations' (like an ICT node?) that has 'sensor groups' such
as an envpro, which has 'sensors' corresponding to single measurements such as soil moisture at 10cm.

Within a sensor group there are multiple sensor types, such as soilMoistureContent. Within the sensor type is an array
of sensors - for an EnvPro there is a sensor per depth 10cm, 20cm...

A sensor group reading from the API endpoint https://api.greenbrain.net.au/v3/sensor-groups/{id}/latest looks like:
